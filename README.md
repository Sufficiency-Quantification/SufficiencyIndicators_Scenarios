# Scenarios Analysis

## Description

This Notebook shows how Plots for the comparison of different Sufficiency Scenarios are created. As a Data Resource a Google Spreadsheet is used, which is then loaded and processed by the Notebook.

## Installation

The Notebook can directly be used to create the plots. Therefore either the whole notebook can be run or cell by cell. In order to work the libraries with versions:
- __pandas__ 2.0.0
- __matplotlib__ 3.7.1
- __numpy__ 1.24.2 

Using pip the versions can be installed using the __requirements.txt__. Therefore use
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With anaconda the __environment.yml__ can be used with the following code in an anaconda shell
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

When using anaconda and Visual Studio Code, you might need to install openpyxl via pip in order to be able to export the Datatables as exel files using pandas.
